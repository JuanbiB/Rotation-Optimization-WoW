- Should we manage buffs like Colossus Smash when writing down the rewards for the next state depending
  on whether it's active or not?
- Would a DoT like Rend play it into the amount of damage done next state?

I mean, otherwise how would we realize that these actions are beneficial?
The rewards in the next state are contingent on the absence or presence of damage enhancing effects.

What other abilities are there that can affect such a thing?
- Battle Cry: yet, this increases the damage of everything by a factor of two, so why wouldn't it be important?
  But what, then, of normal critical strikes? Should they be counted?
  ^ No, they should not, because you have no knowledge of whether it's going to crit or not, that's probability.
    Battlecry and Colossus Smash, on the other hand, have guaranteed effects that you can count on.

Rend is also a guaranteed effect.

Verdict: I'm going to include the effects of all these abilities on the next states. Must fix construct next state.

Pertinent abilities to check:
	  Avatar
	  Battle Cry
	  Colossus Smash

Should we even consider AoE dps abilities?
Are we not optimizing single target DPS??
